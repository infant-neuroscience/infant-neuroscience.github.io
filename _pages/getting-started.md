## Advances in Infant Neuroscience
## What state-of-the-art imaging can reveal about the developing mind?

Pivotal advances in our understanding of the developing human mind have systematically been made possible by progress in experimental methodologies. Cognitive neuroscience has recently seen a great rise of new technologies and data analysis techniques that allow us to study neural processes underlying cognition with ever greater insight. Our workshop aims to introduce a tailored selection of those techniques, best suited for studying infants, to the cognitive development community and place them within the context of brain development during the first year of life. Specifically, we will cover fMRI in awake infants, frequency tagging, decoding and representational similarity analysis. We will discuss how to best use these methods to address and (hopefully answer) deep questions about infant cognition. During a practical session, participants will have the opportunity to brainstorm experimental applications in their areas of research and consult with the experts.


Our main motivation is twofold: (1) to equip developmental scientists with conceptual understanding of state-of-the art cognitive neuroscience tools that will enable them to use these tools in their future work; (2) to showcase important questions about human cognition that these methods allow to tackle. We will also point participants to tutorials and computing tools which they can use to implement the discussed concepts, and should there be interest we will organize a follow-up on-line walk-through about the most in-demand methods.


### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the `_config.yml` file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here.

Making a change to `_config.yml` (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Create a new file called `/_posts/2019-2-13-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. That's all you need to do to publish your first blog post! This [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might come in handy while writing the posts.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the <kbd>Create new file</kbd> button in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Using Categories in Reverie

You can categorize your content based on `categories` in Reverie. For this, you just need to add `categories` in front matter like below:

For adding single category:

```md
categories: JavaScript
```

For adding multiple categories:

```md
categories: [PHP, Laravel]
```

The contegorized content can be shown over this URL: <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/categories/>

## RSS

The generated [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/feed>. You can see the example RSS feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/feed).

## Sitemap

The generated sitemap of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/sitemap>. You can see the example sitemap feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/sitemap).
