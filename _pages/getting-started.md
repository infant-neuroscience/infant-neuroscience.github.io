### Advances in Infant Neuroscience
### What state-of-the-art imaging can reveal about the developing mind?

Pivotal advances in our understanding of the developing human mind have systematically been made possible by progress in experimental methodologies. Cognitive neuroscience has recently seen a great rise of new technologies and data analysis techniques that allow us to study neural processes underlying cognition with ever greater insight. Our workshop aims to introduce a tailored selection of those techniques, best suited for studying infants, to the cognitive development community and place them within the context of brain development during the first year of life. Specifically, we will cover fMRI in awake infants, frequency tagging, decoding and representational similarity analysis. We will discuss how to best use these methods to address and (hopefully answer) deep questions about infant cognition. During a practical session, participants will have the opportunity to brainstorm experimental applications in their areas of research and consult with the experts.


Our main motivation is twofold: (1) to equip developmental scientists with conceptual understanding of state-of-the art cognitive neuroscience tools that will enable them to use these tools in their future work; (2) to showcase important questions about human cognition that these methods allow to tackle. We will also point participants to tutorials and computing tools which they can use to implement the discussed concepts, and should there be interest we will organize a follow-up on-line walk-through about the most in-demand methods.


### Program

8:30-8:35 - Intro & workshop goals, Barbara Pomiechowska
8:35-9:20 Session 1: Exploring early brain development with infant neuroimaging: from structural foundations to the maturation of functional networks, Jessica Dubois (INSERM, CEA, Université Paris-Cité)
During the prenatal and early postnatal period, intense brain development relies on complex mechanisms, interacting and modulated by genetic, epigenetic and activity-dependent factors. In recent years, infant neuroimaging has provided us with in vivo markers of these mechanisms and shown the early architecture and progressive maturation of brain networks. In this talk, I will discuss the functional significance of specific anatomical processes such as brain folding and myelination, based on recent studies comparing complementary measures of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and longitudinal behavioral assessments.
9:20-10:05 Session 2: Awake, task-based fMRI as a window into infant perception and memory, Tristan Yates (Columbia University)
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the dominant neuroscientific method for studying cognitive processes in adults, adolescents, and older children. However, up until recently, infants and toddlers have been notably absent from (awake, task-based) fMRI research, given the difficulties associated with data collection. In this talk, I will present an overview of awake infant fMRI as a tool for understanding the infant mind. I will argue that the properties of fMRI (e.g., whole-brain resolution, access to midline and deep brain structures, well-established paradigms/analyses from adult neuroscience) are well-suited for answering questions about how infants perceive and remember their world. 
10:05-10:30 coffee break
10:30-11:15 Session 3: Brain rhythms and entrainment in developmental neuroscience, Moritz Köster
Rhythmic visual stimulation (RVS) has long been used to study the development of the visual system and applications have more recently been expanded to uncover higher cognitive functions in the developing brain, including overt and covert attention, face and object perception, numeral cognition, and predictive processing. These insights are owed to the unique benefits of RVS, such as the targeted frequency and stimulus-specific neural responses, as well as a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio. Yet, neural mechanisms underlying the RVS response are still poorly understood. I will introduce the topic of neural oscillations and discuss advances and challenges in developmental RVS studies.
11:15-12:00 Session 4: From responses to representations in developmental neuroimaging, Laurie Bayet
Multivariate, “decoding” approaches to neuroimaging provide a window into the developmental origins of perceptual and cognitive representations. This talk will show how these computational tools, such as multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis, may be applied to characterize the temporal dynamics and properties of perceptual representations in the developing brain.

12:00-12:30 Session 5: Hands-on practical on experimental design, moderator: Barbara Pomiechowska (University of Birmingham)
This session will be dedicated to experimental design. Participants will work in groups to brainstorm about applying a technique of their choice to their research areas. The experts will advise them and address their questions.

### Speakers

Laurie Baeyet (American University)
Dr Laurie Bayet is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist interested in infant cognitive development and high-level vision. Her lab combines electro-encephalography (EEG), behavioral methods, and computational tools to uncover how infants and young children learn to interpret complex visual objects, such as visual objects that are relevant to affective, social communication.
